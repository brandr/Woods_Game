-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming (unblocked)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation
---------------------------------------------------

What to do when we hit the "error generating level" breakpoint?
	* also make sure we fix infinite loop that can happen in while loop for generating paths 
Add ability for forced changes to happen on certain dates and based on certain qualifiers
	* example: eye of pan symbol on community center changes to cross when renaldo makes it his church
Improve generation performance (both time it takes and memory usage)
Finish LevelGenSite
	* Maybe allow critters to have site-based spawning?
	* will it be feasible to have the code figure out what order to place/generate keyed path nodes in? 
		or would it work better to just put them in the right order in the xml?

---------------------------------------------------
Critters
---------------------------------------------------

Critter spawning/biomes
	* when should critters despawn?
	* incorporate level size when calculating spawn chance/max critters to spawn for biome
	* some critters might be under rocks, some indoors, some in ferns, etc-- how to categorize possible spawn locations?
	* Maybe some critter types are set to only appear n days into the game (seasonal for early/late summer?)
	* it's possible to catch bugs on the ground before the net hits the ground-- is this worth fixing?
		# not enough to just change the mask to not allow catching in the air-- flying bugs can be caught that way (need to measure "height")
		# Could make flying bugs render on the correct layer by putting their center pos on the ground "below" them
			$ this will make no sense visually when they're really high up, so make them disappear if they go too high
Basic AI
	* what can critters do besides wander? how to decide?
	* some critters should flee if player gets close
		# this could be a good time to add sneaking mechanics -- tap control stick lightly on controller, press/hold some button on keyboard
Make other critters and large animals
Fix bug where critters get stuck sometimes (either in wall or against it)

---------------------------------------------------
Controls
---------------------------------------------------

Make custom mouse cursor (allow switching based on context/ what we're hovering over)	
Test encyclopedia scrolling once we have enough encyclopedia items to scroll (both mouse scrolling and tab scrolling)
Need more intuitive way to display/back out of encyclopedia category
Need way to back out of load part of main menu

---------------------------------------------------
Menus
---------------------------------------------------

Display the current day and other info for a save in title screen menu 
Encyclopedia
	* What to show in main section when no entry is selected? (% discovered, summary, category image, etc.)
	* Could track NPCs in encyclopedia (bombers notebook-style schedule)
	* Add latin name, num caught, and other info to display

---------------------------------------------------
Level editor
---------------------------------------------------

Fix bug where XML attributes can get saved twice after editing via ctrl-click
Add specific editor components for things like path nodes, tiles, etc and reduce how much has to be entered directly as xml
Fix bug where removing blocks doesn't seem to save (probaly because they only get removed from the tile, not the level-- should be more like egs)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming (blocked/not sure if I want)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Memory management/error handling
---------------------------------------------------

Switch to smaller resolution before worrying about input lag
It shouldn't be necessary to sort images to draw every frame, especially since some are still	
	* test performance without sorting to make sure this is actually a problem
		# no sorting helps, but doesn't completely solve the problem
	* instead, look into doing this for still images when loading the level 
		(maybe storing in a map that we copy and sort-insert moving object positions into?)
Document how to format serialized things like dialog trees so I don't forget
Asynchronous loading screen (still not sure I want a progress bar, except possibly for world gen)
	* https://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/615021
	* https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Allegro_5_Tutorial/Threads
	* add a progress bar (remember to use mutex)
		# how to quantity loading progress? (could split into levels)
If necessary, could make it so we asynchronously load only adjacent levels to the current one
	* need to be careful to ensure the player can't walk to the edge before we finish loading
	* in the cave game this applied only to dungeons, so could implement travel between dungeons and make it work like that
	* might be easier to just fade to black and have loading screens between areas
Performance on large levels seems to be mostly fixed, but comes back in some cases.
	* the previous problem was in Level.draw()-- sorting draw_entities when there are a lot of them, so see if this might be related
Fix build warnings

---------------------------------------------------
NPCs
---------------------------------------------------

AIState/NPC schedule
	- use schedule logic to determine NPC spawn locations (not sure if necessary yet)
		* might become necessary if the world is so big we have to split out dungeons and calculate NPC locations when player enters an area
	- Can use qualifiers on interact actions to make doors only open at a certain time
		* see if it's possible to "branch" actions this way and put multiple actions with different qualfiers on the same door
		* this allows "you must be friends with X to go here"
NPC pathing
	- Set a debug launch argument to control whether test rect bitmaps appear
		* Manage the bitmaps through ImageLoader
		* instead of launch argument, could add console commands (this applies to FPS display too)
Should you be unable to talk to the same NPC too many times a day like in stardew?
	- probably need a lot more actual gameplay to answer this question

---------------------------------------------------
Audio
---------------------------------------------------

Full documentation of allegro audio: https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/audio.html
Music
	* see world.music_update() -- weather effects separate from music? (and ambient sounds like birds singing)
	* should music fade out before finishing sometimes so we don't stop it so abruptly?
	* short jingles for things like quests? (these should probably be SFX but not sure)

---------------------------------------------------
Stamina
---------------------------------------------------

Tweak formula in player.stamina_update() and player.calculate_stamina_gain, etc.
	* max stamina levels up very slightly every day (need a well-balanced formula and an absolute maximum)
	* maybe have some simple "health" mechanics influence stamina, dictated by exercise,
			eating good food, etc. (make a stub method like "daily health multipler" and leave a todo for now)
	* running should be significantly less stamina-efficient 
		-- it shouldn't only drain faster, you should lose more stamina per unit traveled than walking

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-Programming
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Audio
---------------------------------------------------

Sound effects	
	* Add sounds: 
		- menu sounds 
			# make the scroll sounds shorter in duration so they don't get cut off when rapidly activated
		- dialog sounds
			# make more voices
			# make a default voice
				* use this (and possibly other voices that can be set) for things like signs
				* audio should be things that aren't actually recordings of human voice, but still have 26 "characters"

Replace placeholder sounds based on filenames

---------------------------------------------------
Inventory/items/money
---------------------------------------------------

Make an item shop (or at least someone who sells things)
	* to remove money, use "adjust_money_amount" interactAction and make sure it works for negative numbers
Make mallet able to break rocks, add swinging animation and animations for rocks being hit/destroyed
	* first make sure I actually want the mallet in the game (balance)

---------------------------------------------------
Animation/image code
---------------------------------------------------

Give player a "pass out" animation for end of day
could make stairs an entitygroup and use an optical illusion to make it look like you're walking "up" it
make egs you can walk "under" like garden archways (I think we can do this using a "center" lower than the actual sprite)
Give trees shadows and ensure they cover only the objects I want
Add shallow water tiles we can wade through (use brush animations to cover player feet and splash footstep sounds)
Add more detailed night/day filters (but keep in mind they need to be compatible with the single-color filter since the filter code relies on that)
Add EntityGroup filters (see Level.draw())
	# done, but not tested (need to copy over for genned egs? can test this with large tree shadows) 

---------------------------------------------------
Long term
---------------------------------------------------

Populate the encyclopedia
Look up how to get on steam ahead of time
When balancing money, adjust for inflation for 1987
