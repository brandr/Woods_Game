Woods game todolist

-figure out how we want objects to be rendered and what kind of camera style we want-- could go for a look with a slight angle (example: stardew valley)
	*carefully consider how trees in particular will look since the player will spend a lot of time in the forest
		#idea: have the trees' leaves turn transparent when the player is colliding with them visually
	*could reinforce the appearance of 3D by giving objects masks that are just ovals/diamonds around the "base" of the object (so the player can walk behind solid objects)
-test and refine collisions on slow terrain
	*also test with controller
-fix glitch where player can get stuck inside a block by holding in a direction when traveling between levels
-finish sorting out memory leaks (note that some of them don't actually seem to be real leaks but need to make sure)
-figure out what kind of world/dungeon/level system we want
-idea: put level coords and dimensions in the corresponding files
	*could also put them in different files and load the dungeon based on this data
-test large levels to see if there is lag when entering them
-figure out how to handle player leaving the level when there's no corresponding level
-implement backgrounds simlarly to tutorial tile system (think in terms of layers and have the different layers rendered on top of each other, possibly using a transparent color with background images)
	*either implement parallax or plan for it
