Code Prioritization
---------------------------------------------------

Last updated 5/25/2020

Target date for main code to be done: ~ Sep 2020

1. Critters
	(5-10 days)
2. Audio
	(5-10 days)
3. Animation code
	(5-10 days)
4. Miscellaneous code stuff (break out into specific todos after getting here)
	(???)
5. Level Editor improvements
	(???)
6. Content!
	(???)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming (unblocked)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Misc
---------------------------------------------------

Make it so time doesn't pass until the player first goes downstairs on day 1 and can't use bed/calendar

---------------------------------------------------
Controls
---------------------------------------------------

Make custom mouse cursors vary based on context
	* MainGameScreen (need to change based on what we hover over)
	* inventory screen (probably need special icons for dragging, and test exchange inventory too)
Need more intuitive way to display/back out of encyclopedia category
Need way to back out of load part of main menu

---------------------------------------------------
Critters
---------------------------------------------------

Critter spawning/biomes
	* incorporate level size when calculating spawn chance/max critters to spawn for biome
	* some critters might be under rocks, some indoors, some in ferns, etc-- how to categorize possible spawn locations?
Basic AI
	* what can critters do besides wander? how to decide?
	* some critters should flee if player gets close
		# this could be a good time to add sneaking mechanics -- tap control stick lightly on controller, press/hold some button on keyboard

---------------------------------------------------
Menus
---------------------------------------------------

Display the current day and other info for a save in title screen menu 
Encyclopedia
	* What to show in main section when no entry is selected? (% discovered, summary, category image, etc.)
	* Could track NPCs in encyclopedia (bombers notebook-style schedule)
	* Add latin name, num caught, and other info to display

---------------------------------------------------
Level editor
---------------------------------------------------

Fix bug where XML attributes can get saved twice after editing via ctrl-click
Add specific editor components for things like path nodes, tiles, etc and reduce how much has to be entered directly as xml
Fix bug where removing blocks doesn't seem to save (probaly because they only get removed from the tile, not the level-- should be more like egs)

---------------------------------------------------
Misc
---------------------------------------------------

Fix bug where player "snaps" position on new day after sleeping in bed

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming (blocked/not sure what I want)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation
---------------------------------------------------

What to do when we hit the "error generating level" breakpoint?
	* also make sure this still happens-- not sure if it's possible anymore
LevelGenSite
	* will it always be feasible to have the code figure out what order to place/generate keyed path nodes in? 
		or would it work better to just put them in the right order in the xml?
	* Maybe allow critters to have site-based spawning?

---------------------------------------------------
Critters
---------------------------------------------------

Critter spawning/biomes
	* when should critters despawn/respawn? (need core gameplay loop more refined to answer this)
	* Maybe some critter types are set to only appear n days into the game (seasonal for early/late summer?) Can  this be done currently with qualifiers?
Fix bug where critters get stuck sometimes (either in wall or against it)
	* also make sure this is actually happening

---------------------------------------------------
Memory management/error handling
---------------------------------------------------

Switch to smaller resolution before worrying about input lag
It shouldn't be necessary to sort images to draw every frame, especially since some are still	
	* test performance without sorting to make sure this is actually a problem
		# no sorting helps, but doesn't completely solve the problem
	* instead, look into doing this for still images when loading the level 
		(maybe storing in a map that we copy and sort-insert moving object positions into?)
Document how to format serialized things like dialog trees so I don't forget
Asynchronous loading screen (still not sure I want a progress bar, except possibly for world gen)
	* https://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/615021
	* https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Allegro_5_Tutorial/Threads
	* add a progress bar (remember to use mutex)
		# how to quantity loading progress? (could split into levels)
If necessary, could make it so we asynchronously load only adjacent levels to the current one
	* need to be careful to ensure the player can't walk to the edge before we finish loading
	* in the cave game this applied only to dungeons, so could implement travel between dungeons and make it work like that
	* might be easier to just fade to black and have loading screens between areas
Performance on large levels seems to be mostly fixed, but comes back in some cases.
	* the previous problem was in Level.draw()-- sorting draw_entities when there are a lot of them, so see if this might be related
Fix build warnings

---------------------------------------------------
NPCs
---------------------------------------------------

AIState/NPC schedule
	- use schedule logic to determine NPC spawn locations (not sure if necessary yet)
		* might become necessary if the world is so big we have to split out dungeons and calculate NPC locations when player enters an area
	- Can use qualifiers on interact actions to make doors only open at a certain time
		* see if it's possible to "branch" actions this way and put multiple actions with different qualfiers on the same door
		* this allows "you must be friends with X to go here"
NPC pathing
	- Set a debug launch argument to control whether test rect bitmaps appear
		* Manage the bitmaps through ImageLoader
		* instead of launch argument, could add console commands (this applies to FPS display too)
Should you be unable to talk to the same NPC too many times a day like in stardew?
	- probably need a lot more actual gameplay to answer this question

---------------------------------------------------
Audio
---------------------------------------------------

Full documentation of allegro audio: https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/audio.html
Music
	* see world.music_update() -- weather effects separate from music? (and ambient sounds like birds singing)
	* should music fade out before finishing sometimes so we don't stop it so abruptly?
	* short jingles for things like quests? (these should probably be SFX but not sure)
	* how to decide music update timer (besides serialization)? maybe base on day length?		

---------------------------------------------------
Stamina
---------------------------------------------------

Tweak formula in player.stamina_update() and player.calculate_stamina_gain, etc.
	* max stamina levels up very slightly every day (need a well-balanced formula and an absolute maximum)
	* maybe have some simple "health" mechanics influence stamina, dictated by exercise,
			eating good food, etc. (make a stub method like "daily health multipler" and leave a todo for now)
	* running should be significantly less stamina-efficient 
		-- it shouldn't only drain faster, you should lose more stamina per unit traveled than walking

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-Programming
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Audio
---------------------------------------------------

Sound effects	
	* Add sounds: 
		- menu sounds 
			# make the scroll sounds shorter in duration so they don't get cut off when rapidly activated
		- dialog sounds
			# make more voices
			# make a default voice
				* use this (and possibly other voices that can be set) for things like signs
				* audio should be things that aren't actually recordings of human voice, but still have 26 "characters"

Replace placeholder sounds based on filenames

---------------------------------------------------
Inventory/items/money
---------------------------------------------------

Make an item shop (or at least someone who sells things)
	* to remove money, use "adjust_money_amount" interactAction and make sure it works for negative numbers
Make mallet able to break rocks, add swinging animation and animations for rocks being hit/destroyed
	* first make sure I actually want the mallet in the game (balance)

---------------------------------------------------
Animation/image code
---------------------------------------------------

Give player a "pass out" animation for end of day
could make stairs an entitygroup and use an optical illusion to make it look like you're walking "up" it
make egs you can walk "under" like garden archways (I think we can do this using a "center" lower than the actual sprite)
Give trees shadows and ensure they cover only the objects I want
Add shallow water tiles we can wade through (use brush animations to cover player feet and splash footstep sounds)
Add more detailed night/day filters (but keep in mind they need to be compatible with the single-color filter since the filter code relies on that)
Add EntityGroup filters (see Level.draw())
	# done, but not tested (need to copy over for genned egs? can test this with large tree shadows) 

---------------------------------------------------
Long term
---------------------------------------------------

Populate the encyclopedia
Look up how to get on steam ahead of time
When balancing money, adjust for inflation for 1987
