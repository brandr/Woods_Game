---------------------------------------------------
Audio
---------------------------------------------------

Full documentation of allegro audio: https://www.allegro.cc/manual/5/audio.html
Sound effects	
	* Add sounds: 
		- menu sounds 
			# inventory
				$ item pickup/drop/swap
				$ item trashing
				$ tab scroll
				$ map scroll
				$ quest item/quest scroll
				$ quest item/quest show description (different from select or no?)
				$ encyclopedia scroll
				$ encyclopedia show description
			# scroll/select for pause menu/calendar/title screen (anything missing?)
			# make the scroll sounds shorter in duration so they don't get cut off when rapidly activated
		- dialog sounds
			# different "voices" (either serialize in dialog or default to the dialog "owner") (need different recordings/applied effects)
			# have voices for things like signs that aren't actually recordings of human voice, but still have 26 characters
			# standardize pitch for base audio and make pitch vary (such as upward inflection for a question)
How to play sounds at title screen (both music and menu sfx)?
Replace placeholder sounds based on filenames
Music
	* How does looping music work? Is there some kind of general fade in/out behavior that should be used?
	* What kinds of things can cause music to start/stop/fade/add cues?
		- probably shouldn't just be tied to level, but could have an override that causes the music to fade out and be replaced by specific tracks for some levels

---------------------------------------------------
Animation/image code
---------------------------------------------------

Fix bug where player animations get wonky after reloading via calendar (maybe need to reset some anim states? maybe we're double-drawing animations?)
Give player a "pass out" animation for end of day
could make stairs an entitygroup and use an optical illusion to make it look like you're walking "up" it
make egs you can walk "under" like garden archways (I think we can do this using a "center" lower than the actual sprite)
Give trees shadows and ensure they cover only the objects I want
Add shallow water tiles we can wade through (use brush animations to cover player feet and splash footstep sounds)
Add more detailed night/day filters (but keep in mind they need to be compatible with the single-color filter since the filter code relies on that)
Add EntityGroup filters (see Level.draw())
	# done, but not tested (need to copy over for genned egs?)

---------------------------------------------------
Controls
---------------------------------------------------

Should menu direction controls be wasd too?
mouse controls for title screen
Make custom mouse cursor (allow switching based on context/ what we're hovering over)	
Test encyclopedia scrolling once we have enough encyclopedia items to scroll (both mouse scrolling and tab scrolling)
Need more intuitive way to display/back out of encyclopedia category
Maybe dialog click should advance regardless of where user clicks?

---------------------------------------------------
Memory management/error handling
---------------------------------------------------

Why do we deserialize the same files so many times? Is it actually necessary? (might be making the game use a lot of memory)
There seems to sometimes be input lag right on startup and/or after standing still for a long time 
	* might need to have ants/lighting in the room for this to happen
	* is it because ants are getting stuck in the wall?
Document how to format serialized things like dialog trees so I don't forget
Asynchronous loading screen (still not sure I want a progress bar, except possibly for world gen)
	* https://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/615021
	* https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Allegro_5_Tutorial/Threads
	* add a progress bar (remember to use mutex)
		# how to quantity loading progress? (could split into levels)
If necessary, could make it so we asynchronously load only adjacent levels to the current one
	* need to be careful to ensure the player can't walk to the edge before we finish loading
	* in the cave game this applied only to dungeons, so could implement travel between dungeons and make it work like that
	* might be easier to just fade to black and have loading screens between areas
Performance on large levels seems to be mostly fixed, but comes back in some cases.
	* the previous problem was in Level.draw()-- sorting draw_entities when there are a lot of them, so see if this might be related
Fix build warnings

---------------------------------------------------
NPCs
---------------------------------------------------

AIState/NPC schedule
	- wander radius (min/max distance per wander) and wander delay should possibly be serialized/calculated
	- Consider letting NPCs toggle lamps, open/close gates, and perform other interact actions as part of the schedule
		* send to a node near the interactable, but perforam the action directly so we don't have to check if they're "close enough"
	- now that pathing factors in tile cost, we can get a rough estimate of how long it'll take to reach the scheduled destination.
		* this is useful for questions like "how soon do I need to leave to arrive on time?" and "am I already too late to reach the event?"
		* note that this is only a rough estimate since we might get blocked on the way. This means it's the soonest possible arrival time
	- use schedule logic to determine NPC spawn locations (not sure if necessary yet)
		* might become necessary if the world is so big we have to split out dungeons and calculate NPC locations when player enters an area
Dialog 
	- should you be unable to talk to the same NPC too many times a day like in stardew?
		* probably need a lot more actual gameplay to answer this question
NPC pathing
	- I saw a case where NPC 2 "wiggled" after reaching a primary node, need to figure out how this happened and fix
	- can end up on top of an npc and get temporarily stuck if you go into a building right as they're at the exit
		* probably want to fix by having you appear just past them
	- Set a debug launch argument to control whether test rect bitmaps appear
		* Manage the bitmaps through ImageLoader
		* instead of launch argument, could add console commands (this applies to FPS display too)

---------------------------------------------------
Critters
---------------------------------------------------

Critter spawning/biomes
	* when should critters despawn?
	* incorporate level size when calculating spawn chance/max critters to spawn for biome
	* some critters might be under rocks, some indoors, some in ferns, etc-- how to categorize possible spawn locations?
	* Maybe some critter types are set to only appear n days into the game (seasonal for early/late summer?)
	* it's possible to catch bugs on the ground before the net hits the ground-- is this worth fixing?
		# not enough to just change the mask to not allow catching in the air-- flying bugs can be caught that way (need to measure "height")
		# Could make flying bugs render on the correct layer by putting their center pos on the ground "below" them
			$ this will make no sense visually when they're really high up, so make them disappear if they go too high
Basic AI
	* what can critters do besides wander? how to decide?
	* some critters should flee if player gets close
		# this could be a good time to add sneaking mechanics -- tap control stick lightly on controller, press/hold some button on keyboard
Make other critters and large animals

---------------------------------------------------
Menus
---------------------------------------------------

Display the current day and other info for a save in title screen menu (why does "maps" appear as an option when loading game?)
Encyclopedia
	* What to show in main section when no entry is selected? (% discovered, summary, category image, etc.)
	* Could track NPCs in encyclopedia (bombers notebook-style schedule)
	* Add latin name, num caught, and other info to display
	* Write up entire encyclopedia in text document before making it into xml

---------------------------------------------------
Inventory/items/money
---------------------------------------------------

Make sure ItemPickups disappear properly from level when they should (maybe on a timer or after leaving level?)
Make an item shop (or at least someone who sells things)
	* to remove money, use "adjust_money_amount" interactAction and make sure it works for negative numbers
Make mallet able to break rocks, add swinging animation and animations for rocks being hit/destroyed
	* first make sure I actually want the mallet in the game (balance)
Error sound in player.use_selected_item() when we can't use the item (specifically not enough stamina or something like that)

---------------------------------------------------
Procedural generation
---------------------------------------------------

IDEA: When procedurally generating woods, allow a few days to pass so plant growth happens "naturally" and we start with some baby plants
IDEA: can make level gen even more random by randomizing some destination path nodes within a network of levels
Check NPC pathing when generating and in new day update (in former case, keep re-generating until it's pathable)
How to place special objects/arrangements of objects that won't always be in the same spot?
	* example: crashed car
	* may want to spawn location markers that show up on map
Make a "PlantType" class or something similar and have EntityTypes point to it with a "plant type key" or something similar if they are plants
	* might not even need a plant type key-- could just use entity key
	* When generating ferns, copy over this data in Plant methods rather than checking a bunch of entity attributes
	* Can still store the entity attributes though, because it's nice to have blocks all be the same class
	* probably only need to do this if plants become more complicated

---------------------------------------------------
Level editor
---------------------------------------------------

Fix bug where XML attributes can get saved twice after editing via ctrl-click
Add specific editor components for things like path nodes, tiles, etc and reduce how much has to be entered directly as xml

---------------------------------------------------
Physics
---------------------------------------------------

For one-way gates, important part is player direction relative to gate-- could be an action binding/qualfier
Consider changing thorn behavior : Instead of just bouncing away, you get stuck and have to "shake" free (which uses a lot of stamina) or cut the thorns
Consider giving blocks optional masks (we use the block's image if there's no mask filepath)
Can use qualifiers on interact actions to make doors only open at a certain time
	- see if it's possible to "branch" actions this way and put multiple actions with different qualfiers on the same door
	- this allows "you must be friends with X to go here"

---------------------------------------------------
Stamina
---------------------------------------------------

Tweak formula in player.stamina_update() and player.calculate_stamina_gain, etc.
	* max stamina levels up very slightly every day (need a well-balanced formula and an absolute maximum)
	* maybe have some simple "health" mechanics influence stamina, dictated by exercise,
			eating good food, etc. (make a stub method like "daily health multipler" and leave a todo for now)
	* running should be significantly less stamina-efficient 
		-- it shouldn't only drain faster, you should lose more stamina per unit traveled than walking

---------------------------------------------------
Long term
---------------------------------------------------

Populate the encyclopedia

Look up how to get on steam ahead of time
When balancing money, adjust for inflation for 1987
