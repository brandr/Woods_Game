Woods game todolist

-make it so objects are rendered in the correct order
	*idea: have a center_offset pair for all gameimages which is used in conjunction with the rect position to figure out the coordinates of the center
		#all non-tile objects are then drawn in order from greatest to least y coordinate of center
-make the leaves as a separate sprite and having them turn partly transparent when the player passes behind them.
-fix the issue where the player can go faster while running against a wall than while walking normally.
-fix glitch where player can get stuck inside a block by holding in a direction when traveling between levels
-finish sorting out memory leaks (note that some of them don't actually seem to be real leaks but need to make sure)
-idea: consider including animation frame duration in the files from which we load gameimages 
-make a small forest level with trails and brush to test basic exploration.
	*from here, can implement items like shears to make temporary trails (this will require changing the level's tiles from the player class,  
		which may be difficult)
	*may also want to implement a HUD and decide how item management will be handled
	*this may be a good time to implement a stamina system
-idea: put level coords and dimensions in the corresponding files
	*could also put them in different files and load the dungeon based on this data
-test large levels to see if there is lag when entering them
-figure out how to handle player leaving the level when there's no corresponding level
-either implement parallax or plan for it
