-figure out a tile system where the player is always on a tile and different tiles allow different  walking speeds
	*this will be useful for optimizing collision checks, because impassable objects can be locked to tiles, meaning that entites which can't
     pass through them only need to check for collisions with the tiles in their immediate vicinity. Only if the entity is close enough to a tile
	 (and moving towards it) is a pixel-perfect collision check necessary.
-fix delay when travelenig between levels
-fix glitch where player can get stuck inside a block by holding in a direction when traveling between levels
-figure out how we want objects to be rendered and what kind of camera style we want-- could go for a look with a slight angle (example: stardew valley)
-finish sorting out memory leaks (note that some of them don't actually seem to be real leaks but need to make sure)
-figure out what kind of world/dungeon/level system we want
-make player animations with transparency and non-square images, then implement better collisions
	*also figure out how to map player movement to different actions
-idea: put level coords and dimensions in the corresponding files
	*could also put them in different files and load the dungeon based on this data
-test large levels to see if there is lag when entering them
-figure out how to handle player leaving the level when there's no corresponding level
-implement backgrounds simlarly to tutorial tile system (think in terms of layers and have the different layers rendered on top of each other, possibly using a transparent color with background images)
	*either implement parallax or plan for it
